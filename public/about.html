<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Enzo Bergantino — a passionate and curious computing student with a focus on web development and network systems. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive websites using HTML, while also exploring the behind-the-scenes world of computer networks and cybersecurity. I’m all about building things that are both functional and smart, and I love learning new technologies that challenge me to grow. Whether it’s designing a sleek front-end or understanding how data flows securely through a system, I bring energy, precision, and a future-focused mindset to everything I do.</p>
